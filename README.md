#Lua stuff

Stuff for Lua game dev *(also learning to
write idiomatic Lua on the way)*. The goal is to
have a set of utility classes to eliminate boilerplate
code when making games with [LÃ–VE2D](http://www.love2d.org) or [MOAI-SDK](http://getmoai.com) games

##Contents:

*For the moment, nothing much I'm mostly
converting/porting/copying [Processing](http://www.processing.org) and
[openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc) stuff.*

  + vec2
    *a Vector class*
